# Latest papers on Agent-Based Modeling in PubMed

This repository is an *Example using GitHub Actions* \[egga\] for the
Advanced Programming with R class. The project consists of a quarto
document updated once a week or whenever there’s a push or pull request.
It performs a search on PubMed looking for the <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=agent-based+model&amp;sort=date"
target="_blank">latest papers about Agent-Based Models</a>. The last
update was on 2025-11-09 00:07:45.

    > To ensure that only the focal customer’s behavior is learned while
    > using neighbors as context, we introduce an asymmetric loss
    > masking scheme that excludes non-focal tokens from prediction
    > targets. The model is trained from scratch using high-resolution
