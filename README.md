# Latest papers on Agent-Based Modeling in PubMed

This repository is an *Example using GitHub Actions* \[egga\] for the
Advanced Programming with R class. The project consists of a quarto
document updated once a week or whenever there’s a push or pull request.
It performs a search on PubMed looking for the <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=agent-based+model&amp;sort=date"
target="_blank">latest papers about Agent-Based Models</a>. The last
update was on 2026-01-18 00:08:44.

    > In this study, we use simulation-based inference to fit an
    > agent-based model of speed climbing to 12 years of competition
    > times (2007-2019). In the fitted model, innovation and copying are
    > used roughly equally by climbers, with copying having only a sl …

    doi: 10.1098/rstb.2024.0258.

    > Innovators might respond by protecting their knowledge and keeping
    > the benefits to themselves-‘information hoarding’-but then others
    > cannot build on their discoveries and again cumulative culture is
